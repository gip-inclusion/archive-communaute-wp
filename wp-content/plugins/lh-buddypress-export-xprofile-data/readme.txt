This plugin lets you export xprofile field data from BuddyPress, as CSV, for manipulation elsewhere..

== Description ==

As BuddyPress powers communities large and small, certain types of site require member profile data to be viewed across multiple users, rather than one member at a time. In other words, wide and thin, instead of narrow and deep.

This plugin is based on the fantastic work done by Paul Gibbs, I modified the plugin he published on github here:

https://github.com/humanmade/Export-Humans

For my own purposes and have republished in in the repository. I find it very useful!!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Buddypress Export Xprofile Data, and all [https://lhero.org/](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-export-xprofile-data/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-export-xprofile-data/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
